#positive feedback content - The Java Fullstack training program completely exceeded my expectations. It comprehensively covered key technologies like Core Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate, and Angular with excellent pacing. The structure allowed for plenty of hands-on practice, particularly during the Spring Boot and Angular modules, which really solidified my understanding. Furthermore, the dedicated sessions on debugging and code optimization were incredibly valuable and greatly enhanced the program’s real-world effectiveness. The trainer was highly knowledgeable, and their well-planned delivery ensured meaningful learning and immediate practical application. Overall, the program offered a perfect balance of theory and practical focus. I would confidently rate it 5 out of 5.

Although it covered key technologies like Core Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate, and Angular, several sections were rushed—especially Spring Boot and Angular—leaving little time for hands-on practice. The lack of dedicated sessions on debugging and code optimization further reduced the program’s effectiveness. While the trainer was knowledgeable, the pace and structure limited meaningful learning and real-world application. Overall, the program requires better pacing and more practical focus.
